# QA Automation project - Restful Booker Platform
 
QA Automation test cases with Selenium on the open-source Restful Booker Platform. 

This simple project automates functional tests by simulating user navigation with the help of CSS Selectors and XPaths and returns test case validations in the terminal.

Since the API is a single page application, the Page Object Model has not been applied, but instead two main files operate the tests for the main functionalities, contact form validation and booking validation.  

Pytest was not used for these tests in particular as the goal was to practice purely selenium implementation.
